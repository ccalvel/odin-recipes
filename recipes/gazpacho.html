        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p> Gazpacho is a refreshing cold soup originating from 
            Spain. It typically consists of ripe tomatoes, 
            cucumbers, bell peppers, onions, garlic, olive oil, 
            vinegar, and bread, all blended together until smooth. Often served chilled, gazpacho is a perfect dish for hot summer days, offering a burst of vibrant flavors and a cool, refreshing sensation.
